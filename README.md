# Real-time-Insights-from-X
Social media platforms have revolutionized communication by providing people with new avenues to express their opinions, interests, and sentiments. The vast amount of unstructured data generated on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn serves as a valuable repository of insights. Analytics techniques can be leveraged to extract various insights from this data. The primary aim of this study is to extract knowledge from extensive social media datasets, discern people's sentiments and behaviors, and make informed decisions. Effective sentiment analysis of people's emotions is particularly crucial for complex subjects such as politics, governance, current trends, and healthcare. This paper focuses on real-time retrieval of Twitter data and conducting sentiment analysis to classify people's emotions as positive, negative, happy, sad, or neutral towards India's national political parties, BJP and INC. By understanding people's emotions, parties can identify areas of weakness and strive for improvement to meet societal needs and address people's concerns. Through the utilization of text mining and unsupervised lexical methods, tweets related to these parties are categorized to discern people's sentiments towards them.
In this project we have tried to gain a deep understanding of X data by conducting a comprehensive analysis of a trending topic. Specifically, delve into the details of a popular trend to thoroughly examine its various aspects. We have used **pre-downloaded datasets**.
In this project we have implemented following things:
**1) Examining local and global thought patterns
2) Enhancing the presentation of results
3) Identifying shared trends
4) Investigating the trending topic
5) Delving into the details
6) Analyzing occurrence frequencies
